# EventTracker
This is a MERN stack application. In this project, I utilized MongoDB Atlas for cloud database, express for creating routing and backend framework, react for client-side JavaScript Framework, nodeJs for JavaScript runtime environment. The user can create, read, update, delete posts that they choose from the web interface. 

Initialized Heroku as backend server that sends API and Netlify as frontend client that accepts incoming API and turns them into web interface
